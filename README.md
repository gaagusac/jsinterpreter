# jsinterpreter

Most of the code for the lexer, parser, interpreter, symbol table, types, etc, is in the ```app.py``` file. The typing system needs a little rework(it's not perfect). You will need Ply(lalr parser constructor for python) and Flask for the app to work.

```pip3 install Ply```
```pip3 install Flask```

after that you can run the app with

```python3 app.py```

Check out the example list and see what the language can do.

Enjoy.
